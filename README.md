# cacophony-web-vue

This is a reimplementation of the [Cacophony Project web UI](https://github.com/TheCacophonyProject/cacophony-web/) using modern practices. It is based on the [Vue](https://vuejs.org) framework and uses [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org) for state management.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
